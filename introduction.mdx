## Introduction

Before onboarding products became widespread, I found myself with the need to create a "tour" for new users of different projects, with a nice look and above all with the possibility to interact with existing elements of the page. Thus was born this project in 2017, trying to simplify the logic of [intro.js](https://introjs.com/) with React components, prioritising to use svg and css features.

With the passage of time and especially with the valuable feedback from users, the package was divided into three main packages that can be used independently: the mask, the popover and the tour (which brings everything together). In addition, the repository has become a single-purpose repository rewritten in typescript.

Let's start the Tour together!

## Packages

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Mask" icon="mask" href="/mask">
    An SVG intelligent mask that cover all the contents except the part
    specified
  </Card>
  <Card title="Popover" icon="window-restore" href="/popover">
    A popover positioned based on certain values
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Tour" icon="bus-simple" href="/tour">
    The Tourist Guide which puts together the Mask, the Popover and more magic!
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
